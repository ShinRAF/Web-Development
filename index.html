                    <p><b>Hi, my name is Stephen.</b> I am very new to the world of coding and website development, and this is a really big step for me as an individual.
                            As I'm still learning, the code is very rough and to be honest some of it is guess work! I have coded this website by trial and error. I've watched youtube videos, read notes and lectures to learn HTML, and as I thought
                            I have a very long road ahead of me in the world of coding. I have coded the CSS mostly by myself, but I have taken some of the Navigation and columns as a guideline. 
                            <p>I have used one of Lizs(Web development tutor)navigation example from class, and one of her sample newspapers. For navigation it was week 6 and I borrowed the general CSS of it but took out some parts and changed things around to make it my own. For the coloumns I found a project in lizs Codepen called Responsive Newspaper Example, some of the CSS looks familiar.</p>

                            <li><b>Develop your code idividually</b> - the code needs to be original, we are allowed to use other people's code but we have to comment, reference and make it into our own. </li>
                            <li><b>The content</b> - The content will need to be relevant to each page. We are able to work with others to lighten the load but we have a choice to work alone.</li>
                            <li><b>A report</b> - A report is needed which will need to inlcuded the development of the website, tihs is imformal and will need wireframes and screen</li>

                <p>Capcom states:</p>
                <p>"Aptly named the “1-Shot Demo,” players must take on the challenge of surviving the horrors of Raccoon City in just 30 minutes. If players complete the mission objective under 30 minutes, they can restart the mission until they use up their full time. 
                 If players succumb to the zombies during their 30 minutes, they can continue any number of times until the full 30 minutes have been reached.</p>
                <p>The end of the demo reveals a brand new cinematic trailer exclusive to demo participants. While players cannot restart the playable demo after their time is up, there are no limitations on how many times the trailer can be viewed.</p>
                <p>In the “1-Shot Demo,” players step into the boots of rookie police officer Leon S. Kennedy as he arrives at Raccoon City Police Station in the ultimate worst first day on the job. Leon must survive vicious zombies and solve puzzles to find safe passage out of the station. 
                With an entire building of flesh-eating nightmares lurking between Leon and his escape while the clock ticks down, players need to be sure they’re killing more than just time."</p>
