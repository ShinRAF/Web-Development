                <p>Frontend and Backend are the two most popular terms used in the web industry, but the difference between the two is quite subtle. They are the two most fundamental parts of software engineering that play a significant role in web development. 
                Frontend is what you see and interact with and backend is how all of it works. Frontend may refer to the graphical user interface whereas backend is that part of the website you cannot see or interact with. The two terms are very crucial to web development, but they are very different from each other. 
                While they are certainly distinctive terms each with its own role, they are very much like two sides of the same coin. The functionality of a website depends on each as a single unit interacting with each other."
