                            <p>To make a website you will need to learn coding languages, you will need to learn terms and how to use these terms. There are plenty of coding langauges to learn but the main langauge you need to learn is <strong>HTML and CSS.</strong>
                                These two coding languages will help you build your website, so they are very important to learn and understand. But before that you will need an IDE for coding, these can be anything from:
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Atom</li>
                                    <li>Microsoft Visual Studio</li>
                                    <li>NetBeans</li>
                                    <li>Eclipse</li>
                                    <li>IntelliJ</li>
                                </ul>                            
                                <p>I personally recommend using Visual Stuido has a feature in which it learns your habits and is able to predict which code your going to type next, and also I found it very friendly to use and I used it to create this website.</p>

                    <span class="headline">Dont stop coding!</span></div>
                        <p> Coding is hard. Coding is stressful. Coding is your mum telling you to keep doing chores even though you've done them. Coding takes time.
                            Coding takes dedication and coding takes practice. When starting coding, always practice and don't give up. Stuck on a part? Have a break and try again later.
                            I've only started recently but I'm losing countless hours of sleep already. What do the numbers mean? Did I forget to close the tag? Where have I made a mistake?
                            But after all this, I've stucked to it and I have created my first website. Coding takes time and practice so, keep coding.

                        <p>Coding is the act of writing a script for your computer, this script will then be understood by the computer and will do things for you. We need to code things for the computer because it doesn't understand our own langauge, it understands binary and it understands, coding language.
                        Where do we start? We start with basic HTML, HTML stands for HyperText Markup language; HTML will allows us to make a basic website which can be functional but no pretty. If we want to make the website look pretty, we will need to use
                        CSS in junction with HTML. With these two langauges, you will be able to create a responsive and functional website. 
                        </p>
                            <p>"Think of your code as a translator between English (or whatever language you speak) and Binary. If you can do this, it will suddenly become much easier to grasp the basics of what is coding. - <a href="https://www.bitdegree.org/tutorials/what-is-coding/" target="blank">Bitdegree</a>

                            <p>"HTML – or Hypertext Markup Language – is probably the most widespread coding language, and is probably the one which comes to the average person’s mind when they are asked the question “What is coding?”. HTML is used in front end internet development, and it is found on pretty much every single website on the entire internet, making it an essential language for any front-end developer to use."

                        <span class="headline">CSS</span></div>
                            <p>"CSS is the second of the front-end development languages, after HTML. It is also quite easy to learn, although not as easy as HTML is. A lot of people choose to learn HTML and CSS at the same time, as you really need both before you can do a whole lot.
                                    Using CSS alongside HTML allows you to style your webpage by customising things like fonts, colours, styles, and more. While the HTML tells your web browser what a certain part of your web page should look like, the CSS code is what actually controls it."

                                    <li><strong>"html"</strong>- This HTML element represents the root (top-level element) of an HTML document, so it is also referred to as the root element. All other elements must be descendants of this element. (Have this at the very start!)</li>
                                    <li><strong>"link"</strong>- The HTML External Resource Link element ("link") specifies relationships between the current document and an external resource. This element is most commonly used to link to stylesheets, but is also used to establish site icons (both "favicon" style icons and mobile home screen/app icons) among other things.</li>

                                <li><strong>"header"</strong>- The HTML "header" element represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids. It may contain some heading elements but also other elements like a logo, a search form, an author name, and so on.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>"h1", "h2", "h3", "h4", "h5", "h6"</strong>- The HTML "h1"–"h6" elements represent six levels of section headings. "h1" is the highest section level and "h6" is the lowest.
                                </li>
                                <li><strong>"p"</strong>- The HTML "p" element represents a paragraph.
