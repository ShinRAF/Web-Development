                    <h1>Flexbox</h1>
                <div class="columnnobox">
                    <div class="head">
                        <span class="headline">Person 6</span></div>
                            <p>"The Flexbox Layout (Flexible Box) module (a W3C Candidate Recommendation as of October 2017) aims at providing a more efficient way to lay out, align and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown and/or dynamic (thus the word "flex").
                                    The main idea behind the flex layout is to give the container the ability to alter its items' width/height (and order) to best fill the available space (mostly to accommodate to all kind of display devices and screen sizes). A flex container expands items to fill available free space, or shrinks them to prevent overflow.
                                    Most importantly, the flexbox layout is direction-agnostic as opposed to the regular layouts (block which is vertically-based and inline which is horizontally-based). While those work well for pages, they lack flexibility (no pun intended) to support large or complex applications (especially when it comes to orientation changing, resizing, stretching, shrinking, etc.
                            </p>

                                <span class="headline">flex-direction</span></div>
                                <p>This establishes the main-axis, thus defining the direction flex items are placed in the flex container. Flexbox is (aside from optional wrapping) a single-direction layout concept. Think of flex items as primarily laying out either in horizontal rows or vertical columns.</p>
                                <p>row (default): left to right in ltr; right to left in rtl
                                        row-reverse: right to left in ltr; left to right in rtl
                                        column: same as row but top to bottom
                                        column-reverse: same as row-reverse but bottom to top</p>
                                <img src="images/flex-wrap.svg" alt="Flex-wrap">
                        
                        <div class="head">
                                            <span class="headline">flex-wrap</span></div>
                                            <p>By default, flex items will all try to fit onto one line. You can change that and allow the items to wrap as needed with this property.</p>
                                            <p>nowrap (default): all flex items will be on one line
                                                    wrap: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom.
                                                    wrap-reverse: flex items will wrap onto multiple lines from bottom to top.</p>

                            <div class="Columntwo">
                                    <div class="head">
                                            <span class="headline">justify-content</span></div>
                                            <p>This defines the alignment along the main axis. It helps distribute extra free space left over when either all the flex items on a line are inflexible, or are flexible but have reached their maximum size. It also exerts some control over the alignment of items when they overflow the line.</p>
                                            <p>flex-start (default): items are packed toward the start line
                                                    flex-end: items are packed toward to end line
                                                    center: items are centered along the line
                                                    space-between: items are evenly distributed in the line; first item is on the start line, last item on the end line
                                                    space-around: items are evenly distributed in the line with equal space around them. Note that visually the spaces aren't equal, since all the items have equal space on both sides. The first item will have one unit of space against the container edge, but two units of space between the next item because that next item has its own spacing that applies.
                                                    space-evenly: items are distributed so that the spacing between any two items (and the space to the edges) is equal.</p>
